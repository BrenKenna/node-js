# node-js
 Includes some basics, utility apps and projects

## Basics

Scripts for super basics on variables, functions and conditions. Extends to classes, implementing them as they are and implementing them in hash maps.

## Utilities:

### arg_parser:

Ongoing utility package for parsing command line arguments, where the user templates their own parser object with global descriptor and global arguments with their descriptor. Actions are supported such as CRUD operations which can their own specific arguments, or action scoped arguments (ie required by all actions). User can query this database for their desired variables and handle assignments thereafter.



## Projects

### Notes-app

Ongoing simple notes app where users can register, create and interact with their own notes. Current implementation is that users write notes to a text file. Desired direction is via json object with additional functionalities to improve adding sections to notes, summarizing their notes data and changing their registration data.

### File Explorer

Simple windows OS orientated file explorer where node.js app functions to serve the front-end with content about the active directory tree such as files vs directories, dates, file summary statistics and mime types. Server listens to http requests from the website, and the responses populate the table which reloads itself depending on user interaction.

Stylings are supported by twitter bootstrap, viewable content includes other web applications such as Fruit-Slice game, Simple Maths game, Drawing Application and a collection of bootstrap styled "*Course Website*, *Company Web Page*, *App Landing Page*" sites too.
